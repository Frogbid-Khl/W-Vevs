                <h2 class="h3 mb-2 mt-2 pb-2">Service Terms</h2>
                <p class="mb-2">The <strong class="text-dark">Initial Setup</strong> service is included with all
                    pricing packages and comes at no additional cost. Our Customer Care Team will provide it via the
                    support ticket system or during a live online call/meeting. But keep in mind - the call/live
                    assistance for the Initial Setup package is limited to 30 mins and only applies to set up items
                    included in the Initial Setup service. The live call is not obligatory for the client, and we will
                    decide together whether it is necessary, a.k.a, if it will help the client with the setup process.
                    The Initial Setup service is available for up to 3 months after the initial subscription to the VEVS
                    Website Builder services. The services included in the Initial Setup package are detailed below.</p>
                <p>The price for <strong class="text-dark">Advanced Setup</strong> package starts at $499. When ordering
                    the<strong class="text-dark"></strong> package, a full prepayment is required. Your active
                    collaboration and participation are also necessary for the Advanced Setup service. The VEVS Customer
                    Care team will deliver the service within one month of placing the order. But it usually takes us
                    1-2 weeks to complete. If we are unable to accomplish the service within one month due to a lack of
                    collaboration and information from the client or no-shows on scheduled calls, we reserve the right
                    to terminate the service. Hence, there will be no refund unless the client cancels the service
                    before we begin working on it. In case of a refund, we retain $200 in administrative fees. The
                    one-hour of live assistance is only for providing setups that are part of the service package. The
                    services included in the Advanced Setup package are detailed below.</p>
                <p>If the Initial or Advanced Setup packages do not meet your needs and you require more extensive
                    assistance, you can request the Premium Setup service. There are no pre-defined activities or
                    service scopes for the <strong class="text-dark">Premium Setup</strong> service. Instead, we will
                    discuss your needs, configure a package that meets them, and provide a quote. The Premium Service
                    can also include select setups from the Advanced Setup package. Therefore, the service description
                    that refers to the Premium Setup below intends to give you an idea of what we can deliver rather
                    than outline a specific package description.</p>
                <p>All Website Setup packages, free or paid, are provided only once. If you require an additional setup
                    service, a new payment is needed, or you can request a live assistance service. In case you need to
                    order the Initial Setup package once more, the regular price is $99 USD.</p>
                <p>Live Assistance and Training services, as well as all online meetings/calls for customer support and
                    website setup, are only available by appointment.</p>
                <p>We understand if you are unable to attend a meeting due to a business, personal, or technical reason.
                    And we will gladly reschedule it. If a second online meeting fails though, we will charge or hold
                    (if the service is prepaid) $29, and we reserve the right to cancel the service.</p>
                <p>Live Assistance, Training, Website Setup or Customer Support meetings/calls require screensharing
                    from one or both sides. Hence, for maximum service performance, we require you to handle all online
                    meetings/calls via Zoom or Skype on your PC or laptop. Therefore smartphones and tablets, as well as
                    phone calls, are unsuitable for the service and will not be accepted.</p>
                <p>All setup services are provided via our online ticket-based support system except live online calls
                    included in your plan or purchased separately.</p>

                    nice-looking imagery on your site. Furthermore, we will also improve the page speed since the images
                    significantly affect the page load time more than all other web page sources. While uploading the
                    optimised images, we will rename image files and add image alt-tags to improve your SEO as well.</p>

                <p>What makes VEVS unique is that we can deliver custom modifications to our software to ensure that it
                    perfectly fits your business model and requirements. Often, a few minor changes to the software
                    functions is all that is needed to meet your specific requirements, and we would be happy to provide
                    them as part of our Premium Setup service.</p>
